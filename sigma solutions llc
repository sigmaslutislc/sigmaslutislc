Similar to banks, credit unions could take up to a week to approve your loan application and send your money. Borrowers must already be a member to apply for a personal loan.

Credit unions may be more likely to approve borrowers with fair or bad credit (scores below 690) because they consider an applicantâ€™s membership history when evaluating a loan application.
