Payday loans

A payday loan lets you borrow a small amount, typically $500 or less, with the intention of repaying the loan plus a fee, by your next payday. Fees generally range from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed over a short two-week term, pushing the APR for this type of loan into the triple digits.
Pawnshop loans

With a pawnshop loan, you offer a personal item as collateral for a loan that’s a percentage of the pawned item’s estimated value. Fees vary, but borrowers could end up paying around 200% APR. Those who cannot repay their loan risk losing their collateral.
Car title loans

Borrowers who take out car title loans put their car’s title up as collateral in exchange for a loan that represents a portion of the car’s value. Finance fees can equate to around 300% APR, and you could wind up losing your vehicle if you aren’t able to repay the loan on time.
